# Aquarium Shrimp Counting System

## Overview

This project utilizes computer vision and artificial intelligence to automate the counting of shrimp in an aquarium using a Jetson Nano. The system captures images from a camera placed infront of the aquarium, processes them using deep learning models, and provides the count for automation purposes.
